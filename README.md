# Project Retired

When AWS WAF launched, this project was created in order to provide the custom code required to use the information that Trend Micro Deep Security had about an EC2 instance in order to make smart rule choices in AWS WAF.

Over time, the Deep Security API has evolved, making this workflow easier using the APIs. Therefore this code has been retired and moved to a separate 'retired' branch.

To create the workflow using the newest APIs, please refer to [Integrate Deep Security with AWS Services](https://automation.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/article/12_1/integrate-deep-security-with-aws-services?platform=dsaas) in the Deep Security Automation Center.
